# 3dPang
Project I did with Eva Tamburini for the exam "Costruzione di Interfacce", 2003

The project is based on Pang, a game (c) Mitchell, 1989
https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang

The project is written in C++, with OpenGL and QT. The IDE was Visual Studio.
I hope you can forgive me for not remembering versions of libraries. My old website for this game is available at the WebMachine:

I created a repository for not losing the code we wrote, and eventually study it again.
Thank you
